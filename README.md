# Lua with LÃ–VE2D

Welcome to the repository for studying game development in Lua using the [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/) framework.

## âœ¨ Objective

This project was created to:
- Explore the features of the **Lua** programming language.
- Learn how to create 2D games with **LÃ–VE2D**.
- Share examples and best development practices.

## ðŸ”§ Required Tools

Make sure you have installed:

- [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html): Programming language.
- [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/): Framework for 2D game development.
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): To simplify the execution process.

## âš¡ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Run the game with:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

The game will start in LÃ–VE2D.

## ðŸŽ® Demonstration

For now, the project includes a basic start screen. More features will be added as the study progresses.

## ðŸ”§ Contributions
